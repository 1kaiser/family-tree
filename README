This JavaScript code queries a SPARQL endpoint containing genealogy
data in a number of different Semantic Web ontologies, including the
Biography ontology [1], dbpedia [2], Friend of a Friend [3], and
Dublin Core [4]. The schema.ttl file introduces some additional
properties to complement the existing ontologies.

This repository includes d3.js and jQuery 1.8.2.
